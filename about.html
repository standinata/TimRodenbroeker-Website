                    Is a design educator dedicated to building an online school and a community for Creative Coding. 
                    His teaching is rooted in a deeply critical attitude to harmful mythologies of ‘technological progress’ and 
                    offers alternative, positive perspectives on technological simplicity. For Tim, Creative Coding is both a simple 
                    and versatile tool – not just to develop design systems for a wide range of media formats. More importantly, to 
                    demystify information technology.

                     the University of Pennsylvania, and Slate + Ash. Together with Dr. Martin Lorenz, he runs the design studio
                      Coding Systems, which explores the synergies between Flexible Visual Systems and code. Tim is also part of 
                      the curatorial team for the Design in Motion Festival (Netherlands) and the International Creative Awards (Scotland).
